Options trading volume and Covid-19 related news

In this post I want to examine if investors tend to trade more put options rather than call options after observing bad news.

Put options serve as an insurance in the capital markets and when investors fear that the market will slump they try to protect their investments by buying put options. 

I retrieved the options volume data from #theocc for the last several months. I plotted trading volume of calls and puts and the difference between them using #python .

You can find the csv file and the code to plot graphs with annotations on my #github: https://github.com/rustemshinkaruk/Option-Trading-Volume
